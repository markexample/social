# Social App
**iOS Swift/SwiftUI Example**

Here is my iOS version of a basic social app. The app user can upload a text post to a feed of all users. Each user has a profile with a profile picture and a list of that user's posts.

Firebase Firestore is used for the database, Firebase Authentication with Facebook Login API is used to authenticate a user, and Facebook Graph API is used to get the user's profile picture.

The app is coded in Swift 5, using only SwiftUI to code the UI. This is a simple social app that was used in one of my JavaSwift Academy courses. Feel free to check out my code!
