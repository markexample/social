# Social App
**iOS Swift/SwiftUI Example**

Here is my iOS version of a basic social app. The app user can upload a text post to a feed of all users. Each user has a profile with a list of that user's posts.

Firebase Firestore is used for the database, Firebase Authentication with Facebook Login API is used to authenticate a user, and the first letter of the user's first name is shown in the user's profile picture.

The app is coded in Swift 5, using only SwiftUI to code the UI. This is a simple social app that was used in one of my JavaSwift Academy courses. Feel free to check out my code!
